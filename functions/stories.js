  {title: 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf', text: 'Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf!" The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces.  "Don\'t cry \'wolf\', when there\'s no wolf, boy!", they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them.  After a while, he got bored and cried "wolf!" again, fooling the villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly, "Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!"  But this time, no one turned up to help. By evening, when the boy didn\'t return home, the villagers wondered what happened to him and went up the hill. The boy sat on the hill weeping. "Why didn\'t you come when I called out that there was a wolf?" he asked angrily. "The flock is scattered now", he said.  An old villager approached him and said, "People won\'t believe liars even when they tell the truth. We\'ll look for your sheep tomorrow morning. Let\'s go home now."  Moral: Lying breaks trust.

  {title: 'The Lion and the Mouse', text: 'Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him. This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him. "Pardon, O King!", cried the little mouse. "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!‚Äù The lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.

The animals who were watching cheered so loudly for Tortoise that they woke up the Hare. The Hare stretched, yawned and began to run again, but it was too late. Tortoise had already crossed the finish line. Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.',},

Now I will give another bundle of sticks to each of you. You will have to break the sticks as a bundle, not as separate sticks." The sons agreed and tried to break the bundle of sticks. Though they tried their best, they could not break the bundle. They failed to complete the task. The three sons reported their failure to their father. The old man replied, "Dear sons, See! You could easily break the single sticks into pieces, but you were not able to break the bundle! So, if you stay united, nobody can do any harm to you. If you quarrel every time with your brothers, anyone can easily defeat you. I request you to stay united."

  {title: 'Birbal Identifies Thief', text: 'One fine morning, a minister from Emperor Akbar\'s court had gathered in the assembly hall. He informed the Emperor that all his valuables had been stolen by a thief the previous night. Akbar was shocked to hear this because the place where that minister lived was the safest place in the kingdom. He invited Birbal to solve the mystery. Akbar said "It is definitely not possible for an outsider to enter into the minister\'s house and steal the valuables. This blunder is definitely committed only by another minister of that court." Saying so, he arranged for a donkey to be tied to a pillar. He ordered all the courtiers to lift the donkey\'s tail and say "I have not stolen." Birbal added "Only then we can judge the culprit." After everyone had finished, he asked the courtiers to show their palm to him. All the courtiers except Alim Khan had a black patch of paint on their palm. Birbal had actually painted the donkey\'s tail with a black coat of paint. In the fright, the guilty minister did not touch the donkey\'s tail at all. Thus Birbal once again proved his intelligence and was rewarded by the king with 1000 gold coins.',},

The man had to walk in the sun without an umbrella but he had to be in the shade at the same time. "Impossible", said the people. Then a villager came carrying a string cot over his head and claimed the prize. "I\'ve walked in the sun but at the same time I was in the shade of the strings of the cot", he said.

"So go ahead and tell me what the difference between truth and falsehood is, in three words or less." "Four fingers" said Birbal. "Four fingers?" asked the emperor, perplexed. "That\'s the difference between truth and falsehood, your Majesty", said Birbal. "That which you see with your own eyes is the truth. That which you have only heard about might not be true. More often than not, it\'s likely to be false." "That is right", said Akbar. "But what did you mean by saying the difference is four fingers?" "The distance between one\'s eyes and one\'s ears is the width of four fingers, Your Majesty", said Birbal, grinning.',},

"How could you belittle your own king!" demanded Akbar. "You are a traitor!" "No, Your Majesty", said Birbal. "I did not belittle you. The full moon diminishes and disappears whereas the quarter moon grows from strength to strength.

Akbar ordered a cow to be brought to the palace. "I want its milk. I want its milk", said Birbal, imitating the voice of a small child. "Milk the cow and give to him", said Akbar to his servants. The cow was milked and the milk was offered to Birbal. He drank a little and then handed the bowl back to Akbar.

Akbar was taken aback. "You would prefer a gold coin to justice?" he asked, incredulously. "Yes", said Birbal. The other courtiers were amazed by Birbal\'s display of idiocy. For years they had been trying to discredit Birbal in the emperor\'s eyes but without success and now the man had gone and done it himself! They could not believe their good fortune. "I would have been dismayed if even the lowliest of my servants had said this", continued the emperor. "But coming from you it\'s... it\'s shocking, and sad. I did not know you were so debased!" "One asks for what one does not have, Your Majesty!", said Birbal, quietly. "You have seen to it that in our country justice is available to everybody. So as justice is already available to me and as I\'m always short of money I said I would choose the gold coin." The emperor was so pleased with Birbal\'s reply that he gave him not one but a thousand gold coins.',},
  {title: 'Question for Question', text: 'One day Akbar said to Birbal: "Can you tell me how many bangles your wife wears?" Birbal said he could not. "You cannot?" exclaimed Akbar. "You see her hands every day while she serves you food. Yet you do not know how many bangles she has on her hands? How is that?" "Let us go down to the garden, Your Majesty", said Birbal, "and I\'ll tell you." They went down the small staircase that led to the garden. Then Birbal turned to the emperor: "Your Majesty", he said, "You go up and down this staircase every day. Can you tell me how many steps there are in the staircase?" The emperor grinned sheepishly and quickly changed the subject.',},
  {title: 'The King and Macaw Parrots', text: 'Once upon a time, there was a king who had gone to visit neighboring kingdoms. He was gifted a pair of baby Macaw Parrots by the king of the last kingdom where he was visiting. They were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen.  So, upon returning to his kingdom, he called for a bird trainer and asked him to train macaw parrots. The king also arranged a place in the palace garden for the parrots. He often looked at them from his palace window. As time passed, one day the trainer came to the palace and informed the king that though one of the parrots was flying majestically high in the sky, the other one was not moving from its branch since the day it had arrived. Upon hearing this, the king summoned trainer and healers from the nearby kingdoms. They all tried their best, but couldn\'t make the parrot fly! He even asked his courtiers to try to find a way to make the parrot fly but they all failed. The parrot was not moving from his branch at all. Finally, after trying everything, the king thought that maybe he needs someone who may be more familiar with natural habitat. He asked his courtier to get a farmer from the countryside and take him to the parrot to see if he can understand the problem with the parrot. The next morning, the king was thrilled to see the parrot flying high above the palace gardens. He asked his servant to call that farmer to meet him.  The servant quickly went and located the farmer, who came and stood before the king. The king asked him, "How did you make the parrot fly?" With his hands folded with respect, the farmer said to the king, "It was very easy, your majesty. I simply cut the branch where the bird was sitting." Moral: We are all gifted with energy to find a success in our life, but fail to gather a courage which is required to reach heights of success and end up clinging to the things that are familiar to us. We need to free ourselves from our comfort zone to explore new opportunities and find a success beyond our capacity.',},
  {title: 'The Needs and Desires', text: 'Once upon a time, there lived a King who, despite his luxurious lifestyle, was neither happy nor content.  One day, the King came upon a servant who was singing happily while he worked. This fascinated the King, why was he, the Supreme Ruler of the Land, unhappy and gloomy, while a lowly servant had so much joy.  The King asked the servant, "Why are you so happy?" The man replied, "Your Majesty, I am nothing but a servant, but my family and I don\'t need too much, just a roof over our heads and warm food to fill our tummies."  The king was not satisfied with that reply.  Later in the day, he sought the advice of his most trusted advisor.  After hearing the King\'s woes and the servant\'s story, the advisor said, "Your Majesty, I believe that the servant has not been made part of The 99 Club." "The 99 Club? And what exactly is that?" the King inquired.  The advisor replied, "Your Majesty, to truly know what The 99 Club is, place 99 Gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servant\'s doorstep."  So the King ordered to do it.  When the servant saw the bag, he took it into his house.  When he opened the bag, he let out a great shout of joy, So many gold coins!  He began to count them.  After several counts, he was at last convinced that there were 99 coins.  He wondered, "What could\'ve happened to that last gold coin? Surely, no one would leave 99 coins!" He looked everywhere he could, but that final coin was elusive.  Finally, exhausted, he decided that he was going to have to work harder than ever to earn that gold coin and complete his collection.  From that day, the servant\'s life was changed. He was overworked, horribly grumpy, and castigated his family for not helping him make that 100th gold coin.  He stopped singing while he worked.  Witnessing this drastic transformation, the King was puzzled.  When he sought his advisor\'s help, the advisor said, "Your Majesty, the servant has now officially joined The 99 Club." He continued, "The 99 Club is a name given to those people who have enough to be happy but are never content, because they\'re always yearning and striving for that extra 1 telling to themselves, Let me get that one final thing and then I will be happy for life." Moral:  We can be happy, even with very little in our lives, but the minute we\'re given something bigger and better, we want even more! We lose our sleep, our happiness, we hurt the people around us, all these as a price for our growing needs and desires.  We must learn to maintain a balance of our need and desires to enjoy a happy life with what we already have.',},
